## Summary 
This program allows a user to request, select, or visualize various statistics surrounding data provided by United Nations to give insight into population and wealth trends for UN Regions, Sub-Regions, and Countries. To achieve this, a total of four Datasets are used as follows:

* UN Region, Sub-Region and Country
* Population Growth, Fertility, Life Expectancy and Mortality
* Population in the Capital City, Urban and Rural Areas
* GDP and GDP per Capita

As soon as the program is launched, it will initialize via a five-step process. These five steps are (1) importing the data into pandasâ€™ DataFrames, (2) merging DataFrames together, (3) adding computed columns to the merged DataFrame, (4) performing checks for missing values, and (4) export of the final dataset into the project directory. User is given real time updates on each step and its status.

Once user enters the program menu after the initialization, the user would have 7 options to select from. These are summarized in Table 1. For example, the user can use menu option number 4 to print the aggregate stats on GDP per capita (US dollars) grouped by either UN Regions or UN Sub-Regions. 

* Print the imported dataframes
* Re-export the entire merged hierarchical dataset into Excel
* Print aggregate stats for the entire dataset
* Print aggregation stats grouped by UN Region/UN Sub-Region and available years
* Print the list of countries that have higher GDP per capita than USA, and the year
* Compare four different countries on various statistical data and plot graphs
* Exit

One thing to note is that some countries may not get accepted as a valid input by the program. Examples include Russia and Iran. This is because these countries do not have adequate data, which results in `NaN` in the merged dataset. `NaN` values are dropped during the initialization process.

The program makes use of object-oriented programming with the help of classes, to efficiently handle data analysis and calculations. Finally, exception handling is performed throughout the program to ensure the program does not terminate if the user enters an invalid input.
