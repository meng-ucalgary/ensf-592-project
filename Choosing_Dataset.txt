UN Population Data
------------------
Dataset 1: Life expectancy, Population change, Fertility
Dataset 2: Capital city population, Urban Population

Possible trends:
- relation between life expectancy and urban population
- effect of urbanization on population rate change and/or fertility


Library
-------
Dataset n: English titles, French titles, Card holders

Possible trends:
- rate of change of number of titles (audio and non-audio) vs card holders
- library service type vs card holders


Cellphone
---------
Dataset: cellphones per 100, percentage of internet users, total cell phones

Possible trends:
- relation between cell phones/100 and internet users
- some suggestion?


Another Possibility - NASA Meteorite Landings
---------------------------------------------
Dataset: meteorite landing location, landing year, landing mass
Link: https://data.nasa.gov/Space-Science/Meteorite-Landings/gh4g-9sfh and https://www.kaggle.com/nasa/meteorite-landings

Possible trends:
- rate of meteorite falling per year per country
- rate of meteorites that were no longer meteorites after entering earth's atmosphere

Shortcomings:
- data available in only one excel
- to figure out country, need external library or database that can match lat and lon with country names

    One possible solution is to use geopy
    Other possible solution is to use Google maps API (https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/overview?csw=1)
    Other solution is to find/create a dataset and then merge it with the main dataset
